# Muts and Bolts
Welcome to Nuts and Bolts, the 1.7.10 all inclusive pack supported by the community.
## What is Nuts and Bolts (NAB)?
With so many Kitchen sink packs out there, what sets Nuts and Bolts apart from the rest?

The answer to this isn't simple, so broken down into key points:


** Mods Selection. This pack has a great deal of mods, avoiding multiple redundancies where available while focusing on getting the best play experience and the most varied options for your game play. We looked at, and continue to evaluate all the mods available, from the well known to the more obscure to bring new and exciting gameplay to you.

** Ongoing Support. Our community has supported the development and refinement of this pack for over a year, and plans to continue to do so for long to come. We have irc, discord, and github where we track, respond to and fix issues that players or server owners may run into.

** Solely directed by and for the community. The direct of the pack, the mods, the recipe changes, the config tweaks, every aspect of it is a direct result of community involvement in the design of the pack, and will continue to evolve as you provide your feedback as well. It’s true you can’t please everyone, but do strive to make it as enjoyable as possible for as many people as possible.

** Highly customized worldgen. We are using Realistic Terrain Generation, with biomes of plenty which has had its configs extensively altered. Adding to this are worldgen additions from mods like streams, and recurrent complex, of which we have over 70 unique recurrents added by our community in addition to the stock recurrents. On top of all that you’ll continue to see many of your favorite mods adding their flavor including thaumcraft, AM2, Matter Overdrive, witchery villages etc.

** Recipe and config rebalances. We understand just how subjective balance can be so we approach it from a more philosophical angle. We tweak our configs and recipes to be somewhat more difficult, but we do so in a gradual, multistep way. Instead of needing 128 iridium for an ME controller you will instead find that all recipes leading up to that are just a little more effort than you were used to. The machines take more power than normal to run, steel may be required where iron once was, but the end result is a gradual increase in difficulty to extend the life and interest of the game without the sometimes frustrating hard blocks in packs like Infinity Expert.

** Cross Modding is rewarded, not enforced. Most of our recipes allow for the use of cross mod interaction to circumvent many of the increased costs. Instead of requiring thaumium to make mana steel for example, you may find mana steel costs much more mana than normal to create, but a new recipe now exists using thaumium which is even cheaper than the standard recipe! We try to follow this same reasoning in most of our balance changes, rewarding people for branching out via exploration or multiple mods. 

** TLDR Version: Nearly 600 commits to our github development alone, over 1000 custom recipe changes, all completely transparent on our github and continually up for community review. Ongoing support, the latest mods, kept updated more often than most other packs and a challenging but extremely rewarding kitchen sink pack.
